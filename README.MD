## Overview

The Room Homepage webpage was developed by me, Okoli Akachukwu, using only plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It was created as a solution to the Room homepage challenge made by Frontend Mentor to all frontend web developers both junior and senior.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

```css
.part2_3 img {
  object-fit: cover;
}

.part2_1 img {
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

### Continued development

Making use of CSS Grids to create the three grids at the bottom of the page would have been better than creating individual div boxes.

Learning of Bootstrap would have also reduced the number of media queries I would have used.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_object-fit.asp) - This helped me understand and apply the use of object-fit in the project.
